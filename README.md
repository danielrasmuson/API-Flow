Add Another Endpoint

### Create Flow Textbox
var textbox = new TextBox();
var term = textbox.registerTerm
term.addSuggestion(suggestWhenTextIncudes, suggestionHTML, suggesitionClick(){
    term.surrond(beforeText, afterText)

    OR

    user.oauth(term)
});


### How to recommend / explor apis
You should be able to look at a site and see relevant API's flows.
The homepage should have some recommendations, hoepfully colorful.

A row of Apis
    rating : icon > icon > icon plain text add this zp

### Pricing Page
monetize: 
limit of free calls - to get creative flows from driven developers
limited to get the money from the companies/devs who use ALOT of calls

slower? extra endpoint..?
